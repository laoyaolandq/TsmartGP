# such failure causes tar to abort even in a case where the results of
# the call aren't actually needed.

# (xgetcwd() may fail e.g. on Solaris 10 when "." or ".." are unreadable.
# On most systems xgetcwd() won't fail even in that situation, but
# on those systems this test will simply succeed without actually testing
# anything within tar.)
